# DBMS.js
A Javascript DBMS (DataBase Management System) using localStorage for client side browser based applications.
## What's it for?
The idea is that for people like myself of whom do not have a web server or aren't a back end programmer, this is a library to help create client side webapps, to be downloaded as an HTML file and used for data management applications and the like.

It doesn't just have to be a database substitute, it can be used as a storage method for a local game leaderboard. The approach used with DBMS.js is easy to learn and get used to, and it's a great way of managing small to large scale applications.
## Why should I use it?
It's extremely lightweight as a library and saves you the bother of trying to save complex data in localStorage.
## How do I use it?
TBC
